If a random person is tested from the population, there is a 16.8%
chance that that person will test positive for the virus.

What I told my friend would depend on if they took the test randomly or
not. If they were part of the random sampling from the first half of
this question, I would tell them that the probability that they have the
virus given their positive test result would only be about 17%. However,
most people getting a test for the virus will self select for the test
because they are already fitting a lot of mathematical models. In this
case, the chance that they have a true positive result is higher because
it is not a random sample. Using this additional information, I would
tell them that it is more likely that this is a true positive result. I
would tell them to think about if they have other symptoms of MMV when
interrupting the positive result.
