With my data, I want to ask the questions: 1) Are the three selected
lines diffrent from each other in shape and size? and 2) are they
representative of the spread we see within low altitude and high
altitude populations?

For the first question, I do think that these lines are unique from one
another for both size and shape. I know that testing this statistically
is a classification problem and I have been doing some reading and
looking at other examples from the lab on how to solve this but do not
have a good grasp of the statistics yet. The lab has used linear
discriminants analysis in the past to work through these problems and
the analysis of a similar dataset. I understand this on a very basic level but
have not had the time to really engage with this problem.

I think that I can use the same statical approches to also answer my
second question. That is, instead of asking how diffrent one line is
from the other selected lines, I am asking how diffrent each selected
line is from the population. This will be more complicated because there
is an additional co-variate added in this data set as the wing
coordinate data was collected by two diffrent grad students.
